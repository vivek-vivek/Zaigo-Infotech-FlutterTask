As for deploying an app on the Google Play Store, here are the general steps:
=================================================================================
Create a Developer Account: To publish your app on the Google Play Store, you need to create a developer account.
You can do this by visiting the Google Play Console website, signing up, and following the instructions.

Prepare your app for release: Ensure that your app meets all the necessary requirements for release on the 
Google Play Store, such as minimum API level, app size, and content rating. You can also run tests to ensure 
that your app works well on different devices.

Create a Release: You can create a release for your app in the Google Play Console. You'll need 
to provide information such as the version number, release notes, and screenshots.

Upload your app bundle or APK: You can upload your app bundle or APK file to the Google Play 
Console, which will then be available for download by users.

Set up Pricing and Distribution: Choose the price for your app and decide on the countries where it 
will be available. You can also choose whether to make your app free or charge a one-time or recurring fee.

Submit your app for review: Before your app can be published, it will go through a review process 
by the Google Play Store team to ensure that it meets all the necessary requirements and guidelines.

Publish your app: Once your app has been approved, you can publish it on the Google Play Store.

These are just the general steps, and there may be additional requirements or steps depending 
on your specific app and situation. You can refer to the official Google Play Console documentation for more detailed instructions on how to deploy your app on the Play Store.
